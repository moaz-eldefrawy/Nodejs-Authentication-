<h1>My Authentication App</h1>

<p>This is an application  I built with passport node module that only handles authentication locally and using Facebook.
Note: I didn't implement "log in with twitter Twitter" option since I have already implemented it manually before. for other websites like Google+ or Instagram it was also not that useful since I have already got the idea. I would rather spend my time learning something more challenging</p>
